Snake Game
Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented in Java Swing. It provides an interactive experience where the player controls a snake, guiding it to eat apples while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.

Controls: Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake: Up, Down, Left, Right.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
Scoring: Each apple eaten increases the length of the snake and scores points.
Features
Dynamic Gameplay: The snake moves continuously, making the game fast-paced and challenging.
Scoring System: Keep track of your score based on the number of apples eaten.
